Env:
On ubuntu:
IDE ->
- Build arduino IDE with. 
(becouse arduino ide is has bug, or more likely ubunty has hard to fix permission access from arduino ide's appimage to ports.)
(platfromio btw for some reason cant get accesss too. Plus as of now lags behind and didnt added support for c6 of many neccessary libs)

- Flash with esptool manually.
- code in nvim, platfromio, or where you want.
